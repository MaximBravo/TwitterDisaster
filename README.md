Starting off with making a copy of Jay Alammar's post on "A Visual Guide to Using BERT for the First Time"

Notebook Link: https://colab.research.google.com/github/jalammar/jalammar.github.io/blob/master/notebooks/bert/A_Visual_Notebook_to_Using_BERT_for_the_First_Time.ipynb

The plan is to swap out the Movie Sentence data https://nlp.stanford.edu/sentiment/index.html with the Kaggle tweet data.
